# Code formatting

Don't use markdown, instead use the more precise latex commands:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}
* \code{print("abc")}



# Introduction

  - Motivation
    + Flexible 
    + Flexible
    + Flexible

# Theoretical details

# Implementation details

  1. Population-tim plots
  2. Sampling
  3. Fitting
  4. Absolute Risks

# Population-time plots

# Case study 1: Veteran data (or ERSPC if we can)

  - First example
  - Show how we can test for non-proportional hazard?

# Case study 2: Bone-marrow transplant

  - Competing risk example
  - Comparison with Cox and Fine-Gray

# Case study 3: Vaccination study (recurrent events)

  - Give a more complex example of sampling; time-dependent exposure
    + Sampling needs to be done manually, but fitting function can still be used
